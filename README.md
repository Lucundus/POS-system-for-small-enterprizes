# Offline POS System

A lightning-fast, fully offline Point of Sale (POS) application built with Electron, Node.js, and SQLite. Designed completely from scratch to run on standard hardware with zero internet required. 

This project aims to help small businesses, coffee shops, and independent retailers manage their checkout operations freely and securely without paying monthly cloud subscription fees.

## Features

- **⚡ Performance First:** Built specifically to maintain high frame rates and instant responsiveness on basic office PCs.
- **🎨 Premium Dark UI:** An elegant, modern dark theme featuring deep contrast, glassmorphism-inspired components, and subtle micro-animations.

  - Pause and Hold active carts to ring up another customer.
  - Automatically save cart states and restore them instantly.
- **💳 Customer Tab Management:** Keep a running balance for loyal customers with built-in credit limit checks.
